The following file contains the main notebook (Run_EMD_Pipeline) and the function that we used for the main notebook. 
Each .py file is named corresponding to the phase it was used for. 
The parse....py files are for the regex, and the rest are for the collecting, grouping, voting-smoothing, and evaluation phases.
 The .sh file is the bash script we ran to execute the algorithms.

Additionally, we provide a link to our Google Drive where you have full access to our data and results. 
The link is as follows:

The main Run_EMD_Pipeline file runs with all the files together in a folder. 
To execute our code, you only need to download the Data, CSVs, and Results folders and place them in the same folder with the code. 
The other content on the Google Drive link is irrelevant to the code execution; it pertains to the preprocessing and algorithms running stages.

Also, the folder contains our presentation, our project paper, and our peer review for the project by Kostantinos Giatras and Alexandros Kouris.
